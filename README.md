# Mosaique Decentralized Workflows

Mosaique provides an approach to build decentralized workflows for permissioned blockchain applications.  Mosaique has built-in governance workflows using mosaique itself.  The systems uses state machines for the workflow logic and json templates to make those state machines data-driven.  The goal is to allow non-programmers to develop and analyze their decentralized workflows and to deploy without having to change smart contract code.  For more information, see the [whitepaper](https://github.com/dave-promulgare/mosaique-decentralized-workflows-1/blob/main/documentation/whitepaper.md).

# Getting Started

Currently, we have a working version of the parser written in Node.js that is a stand-in for the eventual chaincode version.  We also have a sample renderer for Vue.js and the start of a visual editor.  You can find each of these in this repo. Go to the getting [started document](https://github.com/dave-promulgare/mosaique-decentralized-workflows-1/blob/main/documentation/gettingstarted.md) for information on how to install and run these applications.

# How to Contribute

We are currently meeting Tuesdays at 4pm Eastern Time.  We will be setting up a discord channel and a wiki where we will post meeting links and notes.  Until then, please contact dave.mckay@ryerson.ca (dave.mckay@torontomu.ca after Dec 26, 2022) if you would like to participate in this project.

# Scope of Lab
The scope of Mosaique is to provide several useful features to blockchain projects.
- To develop an enterprise-grade component that can be included in other blockchain projects to facilitate business workflows.  
- To provide decentralized governance out-of-the-box for blockchain applications.  
- To give stakeholders the ability to design or modify workflows using visual tools.
- To provide data-driven workflows that do not require the development, installation, and approval of chaincode to implement.
- To allow for approval of new workflows and changes by visual inspection instead of code auditing.
